Flash Replay lets you view quick replays of League of Legends matches. It was created for the Riot Games API Challenge that ran from March 30, 2015 through April 17, 2015. I'd never worked with the Riot API before, so this was a fun little exploration into the data provided from a game that I enjoy and play quite a bit!

It's fun to watch a quick replay of League matches with overview stats at time intervals. It can be especially interesting to watch an URF (Ultra Rapid Fire) match with all it's crazy numbers (levels over 18!). Teleports galore!

SETUP: Flash Replay is live at this address: http://flash-xvcode.rhcloud.com/
Otherwise, the application is just a php app that serves html and javascript and can be setup like any other php app. There is no database component at this point. If you set up a new instance of the app, you will need to copy in an API key into the define statement in /inc/config.php.
